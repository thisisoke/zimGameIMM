// scaling can have values as follows with full being the default
// "fit"    sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit inside window size
// "outside"    sets canvas and stage to dimensions and scales to fit outside window size
// "full"    sets stage to window size with no scaling
// "tagID"    add canvas to HTML tag of ID - set to dimensions if provided - no scaling
